# project_progress_notifier
Simple script to send bulk message by email and facebook messanger.

**Warning! credentials are stored as plain text in a file.**

## Usage
- Put your email and facebook credentials in credential_list.py file.
- Put your email reciepients in emails.txt file.
- Put facebook reciepients uids in facebook_profiles.txt file. Note: name after ':' is for your reference only.
- Put your message in message.txt.
- Email Subject is hardcoded into code.

## Info
I use this script to inform my friends of my project updates. Sending many emails and facebook messeges can get you baned or black listed. Use with caution.

## To do:
- [ ] Move Subject to message.txt
- [ ] Change email method to send all emails in one login instead off logging each time to send email.
- [ ] Add sending of images
